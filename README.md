# Achaea Character Listing Bot for command line and Discord

## Installation

1. Follow [these instructions](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html#discord-intro) to create a bot and add it to your Discord.
2. Make sure you have Python3 and pipenv (`python3 -m pip install --user pipenv`) installed.
3. Set an environment variable called `ACHAEA_WHOBOT_TOKEN` to your token (e.g. `export ACHAEA_WHOBOT_TOKEN=asdfaisodhgoafoisuheaoiughoweiaghwe`).
4. Run `pipenv run python dbot.py`

If it says "Ready!" it should be accepting commands as your bot user!
